Your code is well-structured and quite readable already. You have separated different tasks into different functions, which is a good practice. Here are some suggestions to improve it further, keeping your goals in mind:

Design Patterns:

Factory Pattern: You could implement a factory pattern for file handling. The idea is to have a factory class that, based on the file type, returns an object of the corresponding class. This way, if you want to add more file types in the future, you just need to add a new class and modify the factory class. This also makes the code cleaner and more flexible.

Strategy Pattern: For the text splitting and embeddings creation, a strategy pattern could be useful. The idea is to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This way, you can select at runtime which strategy you want to use for splitting the text or creating embeddings, allowing for easier experimentation and extension.

Refactoring with Classes:

FileHandler Class: This class can handle different types of files. It can have subclasses for each file type (PDFHandler, DocxHandler, TxtHandler) each of which knows how to extract text from its type of file. This makes it easy to add new file types in the future, by just creating a new subclass.

TextProcessor Class: This class can take care of splitting the text into chunks and creating the embeddings. It can also be responsible for combining texts from multiple files. This makes it easier to change how these things are done, by just modifying this class.

QAChainRunner Class: This class can encapsulate the process of running the QA chain, including getting the relative chunks, creating the LLM, and running the chain. This makes it easier to modify or extend this process, by just modifying this class.

Additional Suggestions:

Documentation: As you are planning to open-source this project, good documentation is very important. Include docstrings for all your functions and classes, explaining what they do, what their parameters are, and what they return. Also, consider adding a README file explaining how to use your project, what its dependencies are, etc.

Error Handling: Add some error handling, especially for file uploads. For example, what if the user tries to upload a file type that you don't support, or a file that is too large?

Testing: Consider adding unit tests for your functions and classes. This will make it easier for others to contribute to your project, as they can check that their changes don't break existing functionality.

Modularize your Code: Consider separating your code into different modules (Python files), each containing related functions and classes. This makes your code easier to navigate and understand.

Separate UI and Logic: Right now, your main function is doing both UI tasks (like getting user input and displaying output) and logic tasks (like processing the text and running the QA chain). Consider separating these tasks into different functions or classes. This will make your code cleaner and easier to understand, and it will make it easier to change the UI or the logic independently.

Environment Variables: You're loading the .env file in the main function. It's a better practice to load it at the top of the script, outside any functions, so that any function in the script can access the environment variables.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
