pip install langchain pypdf2 python-dotenv streamlit tiktoken faiss

Main dependencies:
pip install {placeholder}
langchain - <3
pypdf2 - to read our pdf files
python-dotenv  - to enable the environment variable
streamlit - gui

msc:
openai
tiktoken -- openai embeddings
faiss -- similarity search
python-docx -- to extract text from docx

-- later on check through the app and get a requirements.txt

Library FAISS, imported from langchain for similarity search.

faiss doesnt support windows officially but faiss-cpu works.
if linux or mac -> go with faiss-gpu

TO DO:
1) share all the files again with the gpt. 
2) ask if changing print statements to loggings in other files as well.
3) consider changing the name of the file_processor.py it does more than that. and the name is conflicting.
6) try to release to reddit, friends etc. to get feedback and contributions.

*** COOL the refactored version works great. streamlit run streamlit_interface.py
DONE: 
1,2,4,6

FOR LATER:

env names for reference:
ai_apps - desktop (I think this one is dirty and causes a messy requirements.txt to begin with.)
