------ 1 --- refactor the code, double check variable names, add comments, write unit tests.


3) Implement error handling for cases where the prompt (chunks from docs + question) is bigger than the maximum token limit. Keep in mind that it'll be possible to use other models. So a LLM class that is flexible to use with any other model might be good to have.
 



6) are there ways to incorporate something like a debug mode to test & work on the new changes on my app? I can create a new branch in git, but still, what are some other options?


7) Integrate logging for some more details: chunk sizes? params? 

8) cost calculator?

11) GPT suggestions:
Bad: Currently, there's no type checking or validation for parameter values when set, which could potentially lead to issues if invalid values are used.
Improvements: I would suggest adding some validation in the set_parameter method to ensure that the value being set is valid for the specified type.


b) Out-of-the-box suggestions:

You could consider implementing a caching mechanism to reduce the computational cost of creating embeddings if the same documents need to be processed repeatedly.
For handling a large number of documents, a batch processing system might be beneficial.
In terms of error handling, consider introducing custom exception classes instead of throwing the generic Exception. This would make debugging easier and your code more robust.
It would be beneficial to add logging throughout your application. This would help in debugging and also in understanding how your application is behaving in production.
For long-running processes, consider implementing a progress monitoring system to give users feedback on the state of the operation.
Consider adding automated tests to ensure your code behaves as expected. This is particularly important when your application goes into production.
